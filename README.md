# Introduction
This is a collection of lua scripts for automatically handling Forestry bees with an Open Computers robot.

# Bare Minimum Components
Obtaining these components will require access to EV circuits and epoxid (late HV). This is because you need an internet card to pull the scripts from GitHub (it is possible to create all the files manually and then copy and paste the code from GitHub, but that is not recommended). The CPU and Graphics Card can be replaced by a single APU if you feel so inclined. Both inventory upgrades are necessary.
